# Advanced Spatial Transcriptomics Simulation Framework: Theoretical Foundations and Implementation

## 1. Introduction to Spatial Transcriptomics

### 1.1 Biological and Technical Context

Spatial transcriptomics represents a revolutionary class of technologies that measure gene expression while preserving the spatial context of cells within tissues. Unlike conventional RNA sequencing methodologies (bulk or single-cell), spatial transcriptomics technologies—such as 10x Visium, Slide-seq, MERFISH, and Spatial Transcriptomics (ST)—provide crucial information about the spatial arrangement of gene expression patterns. This spatial information is essential for understanding complex tissue architecture, cell-cell interactions, developmental processes, and disease progression mechanisms that cannot be fully elucidated through spatially-agnostic approaches.

The technological landscape of spatial transcriptomics encompasses several methodological categories:
- **In situ hybridization-based methods** (e.g., MERFISH, seqFISH+): Directly visualize and quantify transcripts within intact tissues using oligonucleotide probes
- **In situ sequencing methods** (e.g., STARmap): Sequence RNA directly within tissue sections using localized amplification
- **Spatial barcoding methods** (e.g., 10x Visium, Slide-seq): Capture and sequence mRNA using spatially barcoded capture spots or beads
- **Computational integration methods**: Combine conventional single-cell RNA-seq with spatial reference data to infer spatial gene expression patterns

Each of these technologies offers unique trade-offs between spatial resolution, gene throughput, sensitivity, and tissue compatibility. The appropriate technology depends on the specific biological questions being addressed.

### 1.2 The Need for Sophisticated Simulation Frameworks

The development of analytical methods for spatial transcriptomics data presents significant computational challenges that require rigorous benchmarking using data with known ground truth. However, experimental generation of ground truth spatial transcriptomics data is prohibitively expensive, time-consuming, and often practically infeasible due to technical limitations in simultaneously validating expression patterns for thousands of genes.

Computational simulations offer an alternative approach by generating synthetic data with known properties that can be used to benchmark analytical methods. However, existing simulation approaches have several limitations:

- **Oversimplified statistical properties**: Many simulations use simple Poisson models that fail to capture the complex variance structure of real transcriptomic data
- **Biologically unrealistic spatial patterns**: Simulations often use simplistic geometric patterns rather than mimicking the complex tissue architectures found in vivo
- **Homogeneous technical artifacts**: Most simulations apply uniform dropout rates and noise models, whereas real data exhibits spatially variable technical artifacts
- **Discrete boundaries**: Many simulations create sharp boundaries between cell types, whereas real tissues often have gradual transitions and interface regions

Our framework addresses these limitations by implementing sophisticated statistical models informed by the biological and technical characteristics of real spatial transcriptomics data, enabling more accurate evaluation of analytical methods.

## 2. Framework Architecture and Components

This repository provides a comprehensive set of tools for simulating and analyzing spatial transcriptomics data with various statistical properties. The framework is organized into a modular architecture with the following components:

- Quantitative performance metrics
- Spatial visualization of results

## 3. Theoretical Foundations of the Simulation Framework

### 3.1 Count Distribution Models

The core statistical challenge in transcriptomics simulation is accurately modeling the distribution of gene expression counts. Our framework implements multiple distributions based on empirical observations from real data:

#### 3.1.1 Negative Binomial Distribution

The primary distribution used in our simulation is the Negative Binomial (NB) distribution, which naturally models the overdispersion (variance > mean) consistently observed in transcriptomic data. The probability mass function is:

$$P(X=k) = \binom{k+r-1}{k} p^r (1-p)^k$$

Where:
- $r$ is the dispersion parameter (called `size` in R)
- $p$ is related to the mean $\mu$ by $p = \frac{r}{r+\mu}$

The variance has the fundamental relationship:

$$\text{Var}(X) = \mu + \frac{\mu^2}{r}$$

This framework provides critical flexibility, as the variance structure can be modulated through the dispersion parameter $r$:
- When $r \to \infty$, the NB approaches a Poisson distribution (variance = mean)
- When $r$ is small, the variance can be much larger than the mean, matching empirical observations

The biological justification for using the NB distribution includes:
- **Stochastic bursting**: Transcription occurs in episodic bursts rather than continuous production
- **Regulatory network variability**: Cell-to-cell differences in regulatory network states
- **Microenvironmental heterogeneity**: Local variations in the cellular microenvironment even within the same nominal cell type

#### 3.1.2 Sub-Poisson Model for Constitutive Genes

For a subset of genes (approximately 10%), our simulation implements a Binomial model with high success probability (p=0.9). This model captures the behavior of constitutively expressed "housekeeping" genes that show remarkably stable expression with lower-than-Poisson variance (variance-to-mean ratio < 1).

The probability mass function for the Binomial distribution is:

$$P(X=k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}$$

The variance is given by:

$$\text{Var}(X) = np(1-p)$$

When $p$ is high (e.g., 0.9), the variance becomes lower than the mean, creating the sub-Poisson effect observed in genes under tight homeostatic regulation. The parameters are selected to maintain the desired mean while reducing variance:

```r
p <- 0.9
n_trial <- round(exp(mu_vals)/(1-p))
expression_data[, g] <- rbinom(N, n_trial, p)
```

The biological rationale for implementing sub-Poisson models includes:
- **Homeostatic feedback regulation**: Tight control of essential genes through negative feedback mechanisms
- **Redundant regulatory mechanisms**: Multiple parallel regulatory pathways ensuring stable expression
- **High-frequency transcriptional initiation**: Consistent production with reduced bursting behavior

### 3.2 Spatial Correlation Models

Real tissues exhibit complex patterns of spatial correlation in gene expression due to intercellular communication, developmental gradients, and tissue organization. Our framework implements sophisticated spatial correlation models to capture these biological realities.

#### 3.2.1 Gaussian Process Implementation

We implement a Gaussian Process (GP) model with an exponential covariance function to create spatially correlated random fields:

$$C(d) = \sigma^2 \exp(-d/\rho)$$

Where:
- $d$ is the Euclidean distance between spatial locations
- $\rho$ is the range parameter controlling the correlation length scale
- $\sigma^2$ is the variance parameter controlling the magnitude of spatial variation

The implementation uses the `gstat` package in R:

```r
gp_sim <- gstat(formula = z ~ 1, locations = ~x+y, dummy = TRUE,
                beta = 0, model = vgm(psill=spatial_params$spatial_noise_intensity, 
                                     range=spatial_params$spatial_range, 
                                     model="Exp"), 
                nmax=10)
```

Key parameters that can be adjusted include:
- `spatial_noise_intensity`: Controls the magnitude of spatial variation (psill)
- `spatial_range`: Controls the correlation length scale (range)

The biological justification for using a GP with exponential covariance includes:
- **Diffusion physics**: Molecular gradients in tissues often follow exponential decay patterns
- **Hierarchical organization**: Tissues show multi-scale organization with different correlation ranges
- **Continuous transitions**: Expression changes gradually across spatial domains rather than discontinuously

#### 3.2.2 Hybrid Cell Implementation

A unique feature of our framework is the explicit modeling of cells at the boundaries between different regions or types. Real tissues often contain cells with intermediate phenotypes at interfaces between distinct cell populations, which we model through a hybrid cell mechanism:

```r
# Identify cells at boundaries between clusters
hybrid_pairs <- list()
for (i in 1:N) {
  # Find cells in spatial proximity but different clusters
  neighbors <- order(dist_mat[i,])[2:20]
  diff_cluster_neighbors <- neighbors[cluster_labels[neighbors] != cluster_labels[i]]
  
  # Create hybrid pairs
  if (length(diff_cluster_neighbors) > 0) {
    hybrid_pairs[[length(hybrid_pairs) + 1]] <- c(i, diff_cluster_neighbors[1])
  }
}

# Apply hybrid effects to expression profiles
for (k in 1:k_cell_types) {
  hybrid_cells <- which(hybrid_matrix[, k] > 0)
  if (length(hybrid_cells) > 0) {
    hybrid_effect <- mean_expression_list[[k]][g] * hybrid_matrix[hybrid_cells, k]
    base_expr[hybrid_cells] <- base_expr[hybrid_cells] * (1 - hybrid_matrix[hybrid_cells, k]) + hybrid_effect
  }
}
```

The implementation creates a weighted mixture of expression profiles for cells at boundaries, where each cell can have contributions from multiple cell types based on spatial proximity.

The biological rationale includes:
- **Transitional cell states**: Cells at interfaces often exhibit intermediate phenotypes
- **Cell-cell communication**: Signaling between adjacent cells can induce partial phenotypic shifts
- **Plasticity gradients**: Cells may show varying degrees of commitment to particular lineages

### 3.3 Technical Artifact Models

Real spatial transcriptomics data contains various technical artifacts that can confound analysis. Our framework explicitly models these artifacts with spatial dependence to create realistic challenges for analytical methods.

#### 3.3.1 Spatially-varying Dropout

Dropout (false zeros) in spatial transcriptomics often shows spatial dependence due to tissue processing artifacts, varying RNA quality across the specimen, and local microenvironmental factors. We implement a spatially-varying dropout model:

```r
# Spatially-varying dropout probability
dropout_prob <- rescale(mean_dist, to = dropout_params$dropout_range)

# Apply dropout to expression data
zero_idx <- rbinom(N, 1, dropout_prob) == 1
expression_data[zero_idx, g] <- 0
```

The `dropout_range` parameter controls the range of dropout probabilities, with different settings for easy, medium, and hard difficulty levels:
- Easy: c(0.1, 0.3) — Low dropout with moderate spatial variation
- Medium: c(0.2, 0.5) — Moderate dropout with substantial spatial variation
- Hard: c(0.3, 0.7) — High dropout with extreme spatial variation

The biological and technical rationale includes:
- **Edge effects**: Tissue edges often show higher technical artifacts due to processing damage
- **Fixation gradients**: Chemical fixatives penetrate tissues unevenly, creating gradients in preservation quality
- **Microenvironmental factors**: Local tissue properties can affect RNA stability and capture efficiency

#### 3.3.2 Spatially-varying Dispersion

The variability in gene expression (dispersion) also exhibits spatial dependence in real tissues. Our framework implements spatially-varying dispersion using the distance-based metric:

```r
# Spatially-varying dispersion parameter
dispersion_param <- rescale(mean_dist, to = dropout_params$dispersion_range)
```

The `dispersion_range` parameter controls the range of dispersion values:
- Easy: c(3.0, 1.5) — Moderate variability with mild spatial dependence
- Medium: c(2.0, 1.0) — Higher variability with moderate spatial dependence
- Hard: c(1.5, 0.8) — Extreme variability with strong spatial dependence

Lower dispersion values (closer to zero) result in higher variability in the Negative Binomial distribution.

The biological justification includes:
- **Border instability**: Cells at tissue interfaces show higher transcriptional variability
- **Stress response heterogeneity**: Variability in stress responses at tissue edges
- **Identity ambiguity**: Cells in transitional zones show less stable gene expression patterns

### 3.4 Marker Gene Models

The simulation creates realistic marker gene patterns that define cell types or spatial domains while accounting for biological complexity.

#### 3.4.1 Marker Gene Implementation

The implementation defines cell type-specific marker genes with customizable expression levels:

```r
for (k in seq_len(k_cell_types)) {
  mu <- rep(2, n_genes)  # baseline log(7) ~ 2
  
  # Cell type-specific markers
  start_idx <- (k - 1) * marker_params$marker_genes_per_type + 1
  end_idx   <- min(k * marker_params$marker_genes_per_type, n_genes)
  if (start_idx <= end_idx) {
    mu[start_idx:end_idx] <- mu[start_idx:end_idx] + marker_params$marker_expression_fold
  }
  
  # Overlapping expression in adjacent types
  if (k > 1 && marker_params$marker_overlap_fold > 0) {
    prev_markers <- ((k-2) * marker_params$marker_genes_per_type + 1):min((k-1) * marker_params$marker_genes_per_type, n_genes)
    if (length(prev_markers) > 0) {
      mu[prev_markers] <- mu[prev_markers] + marker_params$marker_overlap_fold
    }
  }
  
  mean_expression_list[[k]] <- mu
}
```

Key parameters include:
- `marker_genes_per_type`: Number of markers per cell type (5-10 depending on difficulty)
- `marker_expression_fold`: Log-fold increase for markers (0.8-2.0 depending on difficulty)
- `marker_overlap_fold`: Degree of marker overlap between adjacent types (0.0-0.4)

The biological rationale includes:
- **Graded marker specificity**: Real markers show varying degrees of specificity
- **Cross-lineage expression**: Many genes are expressed at different levels across multiple cell types
- **Transcriptional programs overlap**: Adjacent cell types often share partial transcriptional programs

## 4. Customizable Difficulty Levels

A key feature of our framework is the ability to simulate data with varying levels of analytical challenge through pre-defined difficulty tiers.

### 4.1 Difficulty Parameterization

The framework provides three difficulty levels with comprehensive parameter adjustments:

```r
# Example: dataset with custom difficulty level
simulate_spatial_transcriptomics(
  image_path = "images/colon.png",
  difficulty_level = "hard",  # One of "easy", "medium", "hard"
  n_cells = 30000,
  n_genes = 100
)
```

#### 4.1.1 Easy Difficulty

The "easy" setting creates data with clear cell type boundaries and strong marker genes:
- 10 marker genes per cell type with +2.0 log-fold expression
- No marker overlap between cell types
- Low spatial noise (0.5 intensity, 50 range)
- Minimal technical artifacts (10-30% dropout)
- Low biological variation (dispersion range 3.0-1.5)

This setting is appropriate for benchmarking basic analytical methods or educational purposes.

#### 4.1.2 Medium Difficulty

The "medium" setting introduces moderate challenges:
- 7 marker genes per cell type with +1.2 log-fold expression
- 20% marker overlap between adjacent types
- Moderate spatial noise (1.0 intensity, 30 range)
- Moderate technical artifacts (20-50% dropout)
- Substantial biological variation (dispersion range 2.0-1.0)

This setting approximates high-quality real-world datasets from technologies like 10x Visium.

#### 4.1.3 Hard Difficulty

The "hard" setting creates extremely challenging data that reflects difficult real-world scenarios:
- Only 5 marker genes per cell type with +0.8 log-fold expression
- 40% marker overlap between adjacent types
- Strong spatial noise (1.5 intensity, 15 range)
- Extreme technical artifacts (30-70% dropout)
- Very high biological variation (dispersion range 1.5-0.8)
- Additional random noise component (SD 0.4)

This setting mimics challenging datasets from tissues with subtle biological differences, significant technical noise, or technologies with high dropout rates.

### 4.2 Hard Clustering Challenge Implementation

The hard difficulty level implements multiple specific challenges for clustering algorithms:

#### 4.2.1 Reduced Marker Gene Contrast

The implementation significantly reduces the signal-to-noise ratio for marker genes:

```r
# Reduced number and intensity of markers
start_idx <- (k - 1) * 5 + 1  # Reduced from 10 to 5 markers per type
end_idx   <- min(k * 5, n_genes)
if (start_idx <= end_idx) {
  mu[start_idx:end_idx] <- mu[start_idx:end_idx] + 0.8  # Reduced from +2.0 to +0.8
}

# Significant marker overlap between types
if (k > 1) {
  prev_markers <- ((k-2) * 5 + 1):min((k-1) * 5, n_genes)
  if (length(prev_markers) > 0) {
    mu[prev_markers] <- mu[prev_markers] + 0.4  # Partial expression in adjacent types
  }
}
```

This creates a realistic scenario where:
- Marker genes show modest fold-changes (approximately 2.2-fold)
- Each cell type has fewer definitive markers
- Markers show partial expression in adjacent cell types

#### 4.2.2 Enhanced Spatial Noise

The implementation introduces stronger spatial effects with shorter correlation lengths:

```r
# Model with shorter range and higher intensity
gp_sim <- gstat(formula = z ~ 1, locations = ~x+y, dummy = TRUE,
              beta = 0, model = vgm(psill=1.5, range=15, model="Exp"), nmax=10)

# Apply stronger spatial effect with additional random noise
if (use_spatial_correlation) {
  mu_vals <- mu_vals + 1.5 * gp_noise  # Increased from 0.5 to 1.5
  
  # Additional random noise component
  random_noise <- rnorm(length(mu_vals), 0, 0.4)
  mu_vals <- mu_vals + random_noise
}
```

This creates spatial patterns that are:
- More irregular (shorter range parameter)
- More intense (higher psill value)
- Confounded by additional cell-specific random noise

#### 4.2.3 Increased Technical Challenges

The implementation increases both the average and spatial variation of technical artifacts:

```r
# Very high dispersion (low parameter values = higher variability)
dispersion_param <- rescale(mean_dist, to = c(1.5, 0.8))

# High dropout probability throughout
dropout_prob <- rescale(mean_dist, to = c(0.3, 0.7))
```

This creates extremely challenging technical characteristics:
- Up to 70% dropout probability at domain boundaries
- At least 30% dropout even in domain cores
- Very high biological variability (NB dispersion parameter as low as 0.8)

#### 4.2.4 Cell-specific Random Effects

An additional layer of cell-specific variability is added independently of cluster identity:

```r
# Cell-specific random effect independent of cluster
cell_specific_effect <- rnorm(N, 0, 0.3)
```

This models biological heterogeneity within nominally identical cells, creating additional challenges for clustering algorithms.

## 5. The `analyze_and_compare_clusters.R` Framework

The framework includes a comprehensive tool for evaluating clustering method performance, implemented in the `analyze_and_compare_clusters.R` script.

### 5.1 Function Overview

```r
analyze_and_compare_clusters(
  # Main parameters
  rds_path = "data/simulated_image_correlation.rds",  # Path to simulation output
  output_path = "results/metrics_comparison.csv",     # Where to save results
  k_cell_types = NULL,                               # Number of cell types (auto-detected if NULL)
  
  # Algorithm parameters
  seurat_resolution = 0.25,                          # Resolution for Seurat clustering
  hdbscan_minPts = 7                                 # Parameter for HDBSCAN clustering
)
```

This function provides a comprehensive evaluation workflow:

1. Reads a simulated dataset containing known ground truth clusters
2. Processes the data using a standardized Seurat pipeline:
   - SCTransform normalization
   - PCA dimensionality reduction
   - UMAP visualization
3. Applies multiple clustering algorithms:
   - Seurat's graph-based clustering (community detection)
   - HDBSCAN density-based clustering
4. Evaluates performance through:
   - Contingency tables comparing true vs. predicted clusters
   - Performance metrics (TP, FP, FN, Precision) for each approach
   - Spatial visualization of clustering results
   - Silhouette analysis for clustering quality assessment

### 5.2 Technical Details

The function implements sophisticated cluster mapping and evaluation:

```r
# True clusters are renamed based on size for consistent comparisons
true_cluster_sizes <- table(seu@meta.data$intensity_cluster)
true_clusters_sorted <- sort(true_cluster_sizes, decreasing = TRUE)
true_sorted_names <- names(true_clusters_sorted)

# Matching number of clusters from ground truth
num_true_clusters <- min(length(true_sorted_names), k_cell_types)
true_labels <- paste0("cells_", letters[1:num_true_clusters])
```

This approach ensures fair comparisons by:
- Mapping clusters to standardized names based on size
- Handling different numbers of detected clusters appropriately
- Creating consistent labels for performance evaluation

### 5.3 Metric Calculation

The function implements detailed metric calculation for rigorous evaluation:

```r
calculate_metrics <- function(true_labels, predicted_labels, method_name) {
  # Create contingency table
  true_factors <- factor(true_labels)
  predicted_factors <- factor(predicted_labels)
  all_classes <- union(levels(true_factors), levels(predicted_factors))
  true_factors <- factor(true_labels, levels = all_classes)
  predicted_factors <- factor(predicted_labels, levels = all_classes)
  contingency <- table(true_factors, predicted_factors)
  
  # Calculate performance metrics
  TP <- diag(contingency)
  FP <- colSums(contingency) - TP
  FN <- rowSums(contingency) - TP
  Precision <- ifelse((TP + FP) > 0, TP / (TP + FP), NA)
  
  # Combine results
  metrics_per_class <- tibble(
    Class = rownames(contingency),
    True_Positives = TP,
    False_Positives = FP,
    False_Negatives = FN,
    Precision = Precision
  )
  
  # Calculate totals
  total_TP <- sum(TP)
  total_FP <- sum(FP)
  total_FN <- sum(FN)
  total_Precision <- ifelse((total_TP + total_FP) > 0, total_TP / (total_TP + total_FP), NA)
  
  # Return combined results
  metrics <- bind_rows(metrics_per_class, 
                     tibble(Class = "Total", 
                           True_Positives = total_TP,
                           False_Positives = total_FP, 
                           False_Negatives = total_FN, 
                           Precision = total_Precision)) %>%
    mutate(Method = method_name) %>%
    dplyr::select(Method, everything())
  
  return(metrics)
}
```

These metrics provide a comprehensive evaluation framework for:
- Per-class performance assessment
- Overall clustering quality
- Comparative analysis between methods

## 6. Advanced Customization

For users with specific research needs, the framework provides extensive customization options beyond the pre-defined difficulty levels.

### 6.1 Full Parameter Customization

The function accepts detailed parameter lists for fine-grained control:

```r
# Example with fully customized parameters
simulate_spatial_transcriptomics(
  # Core parameters
  image_path = "images/tissue.png",
  output_path = "data/custom_simulation.rds",
  output_plot = "results/custom_distribution.png",
  n_cells = 25000,
  n_genes = 150,
  k_cell_types = 7,
  threshold_value = 0.65,
  random_seed = 42,
  
  # Marker gene parameters
  marker_params = list(
    marker_genes_per_type = 8,    # Number of marker genes per type
    marker_expression_fold = 1.0, # Log-fold change for markers
    marker_overlap_fold = 0.3     # Overlap between adjacent types
  ),
  
  # Spatial correlation parameters
  spatial_params = list(
    spatial_noise_intensity = 1.2, # Intensity of spatial effect
    spatial_range = 25,            # Correlation range
    random_noise_sd = 0.3          # Cell-specific random noise
  ),
  
  # Technical artifact parameters
  dropout_params = list(
    dropout_range = c(0.25, 0.6),  # Range of dropout probabilities
    dispersion_range = c(1.8, 0.9) # Range of NB dispersion values
  ),
  
  # Hybrid cell parameters
  hybrid_params = list(
    use_hybrid_cells = TRUE,       # Enable/disable hybrid cells
    max_hybrid_pairs = 1000,       # Maximum hybrid cell pairs
    hybrid_intensity_range = c(0.2, 0.5) # Range of hybrid effects
  ),
  
  # Cell-specific parameters
  cell_specific_params = list(
    cell_specific_noise_sd = 0.25  # SD of cell-specific random effect
  )
)
```

This extensive parameterization allows researchers to:
- Test specific hypotheses about technical artifacts
- Model particular biological scenarios
- Create custom benchmarking challenges
- Simulate data resembling specific technology platforms

### 6.2 Image-Based Customization

The framework uses image inputs to define spatial domains, offering several advantages:

1. **Biological Realism**: Real tissue images can be used to create simulations that match actual tissue architecture
2. **Geometric Complexity**: Images can define complex geometric arrangements impossible to parameterize directly
3. **Multi-domain Structures**: Nested or interdigitated tissue structures can be represented
4. **Custom Challenges**: Artificial images can create specific test cases for algorithm evaluation

The image processing pipeline includes:
- Grayscale conversion for multi-channel images
- Intensity thresholding to define tissue regions
- K-means++ clustering to define spatial domains

## 7. Statistical Properties and Advantages

### 7.1 Statistical Properties of the Simulation

#### 7.1.1 Overdispersion Modeling

The Negative Binomial distribution used for most genes models overdispersion in gene expression, a key property of real transcriptomic data. The variance-mean relationship is:

$$\text{Var}(X) = \mu + \frac{\mu^2}{r}$$

This allows the variance to exceed the mean by an amount proportional to the square of the mean, matching empirical observations from real data.

#### 7.1.2 Sub-Poisson Variation

For stable genes, the Binomial distribution with high success probability creates a sub-Poisson variance pattern:

$$\text{Var}(X) = np(1-p)$$

When p is large (e.g., 0.9), the variance is less than the mean (np), providing a realistic model for constitutively expressed genes.

#### 7.1.3 Spatial Correlation Structure

The Gaussian Process implements a continuous spatial correlation structure with an exponential covariance function:

$$C(d) = \sigma^2 \exp(-d/\rho)$$

This creates smooth spatial patterns that mimic the continuous nature of biological processes across tissue.

#### 7.1.4 Varying Noise at Boundaries

The spatially-varying dispersion and dropout models capture important biological realities:
- Expression is more variable at tissue boundaries
- Technical artifacts (dropouts) are more common at edges
- There's a gradual transition between different cell types/regions

### 7.2 Advantages Over Alternative Approaches

#### 7.2.1 Compared to Simple Poisson Models

Traditional simulations often use Poisson distributions, which:
- Constrain variance to equal the mean
- Cannot model overdispersion seen in real data
- Miss the heterogeneous noise structure across tissue

Our Negative Binomial approach provides:
- Flexible variance-mean relationships
- Spatially varying dispersion
- More realistic expression distributions

#### 7.2.2 Compared to Uniform Dropout Models

Many simulations use uniform random dropout, while our approach:
- Models spatially-varying dropout rates
- Creates realistic patterns of missing data
- Reflects the true technical biases in spatial transcriptomics

The implementation creates more realistic technical artifacts by:
- Linking dropout to spatial location
- Creating higher dropout at domain boundaries
- Modeling the relationship between technical artifacts and biological variation

#### 7.2.3 Compared to Discrete Spatial Correlations

Simple approaches might model correlation only within predefined regions, while our GP approach:
- Creates continuous correlation patterns
- Allows smooth transitions between regions
- Better models the true biological continuity of tissues

The Gaussian Process implementation provides:
- Principled statistical framework for spatial correlation
- Continuous rather than discrete correlation structure
- Control over correlation length scale and intensity

#### 7.2.4 Hybrid Cell Modeling

A unique feature of our framework is the explicit modeling of hybrid cells at domain boundaries:
- Creates cells with mixed expression profiles
- Models gradual transitions between domains
- Represents biological reality of interface regions

This approach addresses a major limitation of existing simulations:
- Most assume sharp boundaries between cell types
- Real tissues show gradual transitions and intermediate cells
- Boundary regions are often most biologically interesting
